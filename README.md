# Multivariate Skewness Projection Pursuit

This repository contains implementation of sequential skewness based projection pursuit. For more details and formal setting, please see [our report](report.pdf). This was created as a class project for the [Multivariate Statistics - STAT 330 course](https://academicaffairs.kaust.edu.sa/Courses/Pages/DownloadSyllabus.aspx?Year=2020&Semester=030&Course=00090033&V=I) offered at KAUST in Spring 2020.

Our implementation is in **Python 3.7** and dependencies can be found in [requirements file](requirements.txt). 

We also include [a sample notebook](Example_notebook.ipynb) to show some functionality.

In case of any question, please contact [Samuel Horvath](mailto:samohorvath11@gmail.com).
